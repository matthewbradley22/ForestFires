### Project Description:

Our project is a regression analysis where we seek to analyze the correlation betweeen certain indexes and area burned by a corresponding fire. Our data set contains the location and time of year of each fire, as well as area burned, and several indicators and indexes related to the fire. These indicators are from the Fire Weather Index, and contain general information about the forest such as fuel moisture of material on the forest floor and drying of soil, as well as information about estimated speed potential of a spreading fire in an area.

### Project Goals:

Our main goal is to find which of these indicators and indexes can be effectively used to predict the area burned by a fire. We hope that through regression analysis we find useful trends for identifying at-risk areas of fires in the future. This may include individual relationships between our indexes and burned area, as well as interactions between indexes and weather data. We will do exploratory data analysis to identify interesting trends and follow this up with regression analysis to find which trends are meaningful.
